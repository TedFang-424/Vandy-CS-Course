Update Button: Sure! Here's the code for generating an 'Update' button for the confirmation layout:

<button id="updateButton" onclick="updateInformation()">Update</button>

You can place this code within your confirmation layout, preferably inside a <div> or any other suitable container element. The id attribute is set to "updateButton" to uniquely identify the button, and the onclick attribute is set to call the updateInformation() function when the button is clicked.

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the button using CSS and JavaScript as per your requirements.
